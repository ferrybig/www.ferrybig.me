# Creating a breakout game

Creating small Javascript games is a great way to learn coding. As part of
learning, I developed a breakout game. This game features a level selection
screen, which generates levels based on some math.

This game used the module pattern to connect all the components together.

## Features

* Pause screen using the escape key
* Hidden AI activated using the developer console
* Hidden powerups activates used the developer console
* Uses keyboard and mouse controls
