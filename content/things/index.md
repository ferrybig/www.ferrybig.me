# Things

As a 3d printer owner, I know the fun of making my own models. My favorite
method of making my own models is using openSCAD, which allows you to make 3d
models using just using code, rather than clicking around in a UI.

I have a fair bit of experience in modelling using openSCAD, and I have quite a few functional things using it.
