# My career

During my career, I try to put focus on being loyal. This means staying with a
single company for a long time. This can be seen with the times of my stays at companies.

The value I bring to a development team comes from the fact that I likes to
share knowledge. This means I can teach junior programmers the in and out of
the systems used in the company. Teaching other people skills is something I
like and really useful in the world of open source software. This also explains
why I like to help other people on website such as StackOverflow or Reddit.
